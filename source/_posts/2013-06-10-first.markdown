DEFINATION
The physical or emotional or sexual mistreatment of children.


It shouldn't hurt to be a kid....

Child abuse is physical -- shaking, hitting, beating, burning, or biting a child.
    
Child abuse is emotional -- constantly blaming or putting down a child; excessive yelling, shaming.
    
Child abuse is sexual -- incest, any forced sexual activity, exposure to sexual stimulation not appropriate for the child's age.
    
Child abuse is neglect -- a pattern of failure to provide for the child's physical needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care; a pattern of failure to provide for the child's emotional needs, such as affection, attention, and supervision.
