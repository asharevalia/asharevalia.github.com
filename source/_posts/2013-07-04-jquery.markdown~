<b>What is jQuery?<b>

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

<b>The jQuery library contains the following features:<b>

    HTML/DOM manipulation
    CSS manipulation
    HTML event methods
    Effects and animations
    AJAX
    Utilities
